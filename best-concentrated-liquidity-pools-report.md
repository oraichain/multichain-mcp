## Strategy Considerations for Concentrated Liquidity Farming

1. **Rebalancing Frequency**:

   - For higher-volatility pairs (WSOL/RAY): Check positions weekly
   - For stable pairs (SOL/USDC, SOL/USDT): Can be maintained for 2-3 weeks without adjustment

2. **Range Selection Strategy**:

   - Wider ranges: Lower risk of price moving out of range, but lower capital efficiency
   - Narrower ranges: Higher returns while in range, but greater risk of impermanent loss

3. **Fee Tier Selection**:

   - 0.0001 (1bp): Best for stable pairs with high liquidity (SOL/USDC, mSOL/JitoSOL)
   - 0.0003-0.0005 (3-5bp): Optimal for medium volatility pairs
   - 0.001+ (10bp+): Better for high volatility tokens where fee income offsets impermanent loss

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Allocate larger portions to stable pairs (SOL/USDC)
   - Limit exposure to higher-risk pools to 10-20% of portfolio
   - Consider using multiple positions with overlapping ranges for less active management

## Final Recommendation

For a balanced portfolio approach:

- 40% in SOL/USDC (0.0004) with range $125-$160
- 20% in mSOL/USDC (0.0005) with range $165-$195
- 15% in WSOL/RAY (0.0005) with range $60-$80
- 15% in WSOL/USDT (0.0001) with range $128-$155
- 10% in LAYER/USDC (0.001) with range $1.20-$1.50

This allocation provides diversification across different fee tiers, volatility profiles, and token ecosystems while maintaining strong yield potential. The concentrated liquidity ranges have been selected to balance capital efficiency with reduced impermanent loss risk, based on recent price action and volatility metrics.
