## Optimal Positioning Strategies

### General Recommendations:

1. **SOL-Stablecoin Pairs**:

   - Keep positions within 15-20% of current price for balanced risk/reward
   - Monitor SOL price action daily, especially during volatile market periods
   - Consider rebalancing positions every 1-2 weeks based on trend direction

2. **Token-SOL Pairs**:

   - Use narrower ranges (±10-15%) for volatile pairs like ZEUS/SOL
   - Consider shorter farming periods (1-2 weeks) with more active management
   - Monitor token-specific news and developments that could impact price

3. **Stablecoin Pairs**:
   - Use very tight ranges (±0.2-0.5%) for maximum capital efficiency
   - Less active management required (monthly reviews often sufficient)
   - Focus on higher TVL pools for better liquidity and stability

### Impermanent Loss Mitigation:

1. **Diversification**:

   - Split capital across 3-5 different pools
   - Mix high-APR volatile pools with stable lower-APR pools
   - Consider time-staggering entry into positions

2. **Range Optimization**:

   - For SOL pairs: $125-155 captures recent trading range
   - For token-SOL pairs: Bias ranges toward recent support levels
   - For stablecoins: Keep extremely tight ranges to maximize fee income

3. **Profit-Taking Strategy**:
   - Remove positions when APRs drop below target thresholds
   - Take partial profits when fees accumulated exceed 0.5-1% of position value
   - Consider closing positions during extreme market volatility

## Conclusion

The Raydium concentrated liquidity pools offer compelling yield opportunities across the risk spectrum. SOL/USDC (0.04% fee) currently presents the best balance of TVL, APR, and manageable IL risk, with SOL/USDS and SOL/USDT providing slightly more conservative alternatives.

For risk-averse farmers, the stablecoin pairs (especially USDS/USDC) offer modest but reliable yields with minimal IL risk. More aggressive yield farmers may find ZEUS/SOL and MEW/SOL attractive despite their higher volatility and IL risk.

Active position management and proper range setting are critical success factors for maximizing returns while minimizing impermanent loss risk in concentrated liquidity positions.
