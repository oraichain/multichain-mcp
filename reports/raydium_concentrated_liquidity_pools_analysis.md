# Raydium Concentrated Liquidity Pools Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the top concentrated liquidity pools on Raydium to identify optimal farming opportunities based on Total Value Locked (TVL), Annual Percentage Rate (APR), and Impermanent Loss (IL) risk. The analysis considers historical price ranges and volatility to recommend optimal price ranges for liquidity provision.

## Analysis Methodology

Pools were evaluated based on:

- **TVL (Total Value Locked)**: Higher TVL indicates more liquidity and typically more stability
- **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**: Considers daily, weekly, and monthly APR trends
- **IL Risk**: Assessed through price volatility (difference between min/max price)
- **Historical Price Ranges**: Analyzed daily, weekly, and monthly price movements
- **Pool Fee Rate**: Higher fees can compensate for IL risk in volatile pairs

## Top Recommended Pools

### 1. WSOL/USDC (0.04% Fee Tier)

## Strategic Insights

### Optimal Positioning Strategies

1. **Narrow Range Strategy**: For stable pairs (stablecoins, WSOL/JitoSOL)

   - Set position within 1-3% of current price
   - Minimal IL risk but requires more frequent rebalancing
   - Best for: USDS/USDC, WSOL/JitoSOL

2. **Medium Range Strategy**: For moderately volatile pairs

   - Set position within 10-20% of current price
   - Balance between capital efficiency and IL risk
   - Best for: WSOL/USDC, WSOL/RAY, WSOL/USDT

3. **Wide Range Strategy**: For highly volatile pairs
   - Set position within 30-50% of current price
   - Accepts higher IL for consistent fee generation
   - Best for: WSOL/SOS, WSOL/ai16z, MEW/WSOL

### Risk Management Recommendations

1. **Diversification**: Allocate capital across multiple pools with varying risk profiles
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Check positions at least daily for high-volatility pairs
3. **Take Profits**: Consider harvesting accumulated fees regularly
4. **Stop Loss Strategy**: Set mental price thresholds for exiting positions if volatility exceeds expectations

## Conclusion

Raydium's concentrated liquidity pools offer compelling opportunities for yield farming, with APRs ranging from under 1% for stablecoin pairs to over 100% for volatile pairs. The optimal strategy depends on individual risk tolerance, monitoring capacity, and capital deployment timeframe.

For balanced exposure, we recommend:

- 40% allocation to medium-risk pools (WSOL/USDC, WSOL/RAY)
- 40% allocation to lower-risk pools (WSOL/JitoSOL, USDS/USDC)
- 20% allocation to high-risk pools (WSOL/ai16z, WSOL/SOS)

This diversified approach should generate attractive yields while managing impermanent loss risk across the portfolio.
