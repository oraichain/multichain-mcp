## Overview

This MCP server extends any MCP client's capabilities by providing tools to interact with multiple blockchain networks:

- Retrieve wallet addresses across different chains
- List wallet balances across networks
- Transfer funds between wallets
- Deploy smart contracts on any supported chain
- Interact with DeFi protocols across chains
- Call contract functions on any supported network
- Bridge assets between networks

The server is built using TypeScript and supports multiple blockchain networks through a unified interface.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (v9.0.0 or higher)
- Wallet configuration for supported networks
- API keys for supported networks (optional)

### Installing Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js:

   - Visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Download and install the LTS version (v18 or higher)
   - Verify installation:
     ```sh
     node --version
     npm --version
     ```

2. Install pnpm:

   ```sh
   # Using npm
   npm install -g pnpm

   # Verify installation
   pnpm --version
   ```

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo using Turborepo and pnpm workspaces. Here's the structure:

- `packages/`
  - `mcp-server/`: The core MCP server implementation
  - `agent-tools/`: Collection of blockchain interaction tools for AI agents
  - `agent-kit/`: Development kit for building AI agents with blockchain capabilities

Each package serves a specific purpose:

### MCP Server

The main server package that implements the Model Context Protocol for blockchain interactions. It provides the core functionality for handling requests from AI clients.

### Agent Tools

A collection of tools specifically designed for AI agents to interact with various blockchain networks. These tools are used by the MCP server to execute blockchain operations.

### Agent Kit

A development kit that helps developers build AI agents with blockchain capabilities. It includes utilities, types, and interfaces for consistent agent development.

## Integration with AI Tools

### Claude Desktop Integration

To add this MCP server to Claude Desktop:

1. Create or edit the Claude Desktop configuration file at:

   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "multichain-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["packages/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PORT": "4000",
        "RPC_URL": "your_rpc_url"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.
