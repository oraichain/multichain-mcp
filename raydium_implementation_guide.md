   - Expected APR
   - Price range
7. Click "Preview" and then "Create Position" to confirm

## Step 4: Managing Your Position

### Monitoring

1. Go to "My Positions" in the Raydium interface
2. Check these key metrics regularly:
   - Current price relative to your range
   - Fees earned
   - APR
   - Impermanent loss estimation

### Conservative Position (SOL-BONK)

- **Monitoring Frequency**: Bi-weekly
- **Action Triggers**:
  - If price approaches within 1% of range boundaries, consider rebalancing
  - If APR drops below 50%, reassess position
- **Time Horizon**: Hold for at least 26 days (break-even period)

### Balanced Position (SOL-MEOW)

- **Monitoring Frequency**: Weekly
- **Action Triggers**:
  - If price approaches within 3% of range boundaries, consider rebalancing
  - If APR drops below 150%, reassess position
- **Time Horizon**: Hold for at least 5 days (break-even period)

### Aggressive Position (USDC-AI16Z)

- **Monitoring Frequency**: Daily
- **Action Triggers**:
  - If price approaches within 1% of range boundaries, consider rebalancing
  - If APR drops below 50%, reassess position
- **Time Horizon**: Hold for at least 3 days (break-even period)

## Step 5: Rebalancing Your Position

If the price moves close to or outside your range:

1. Go to "My Positions" in the Raydium interface
2. Find the position you want to modify
3. Click "Increase Liquidity" to add more funds, or
4. Click "Decrease Liquidity" to remove some funds, or
5. Click "Close Position" to remove all liquidity
6. To adjust the price range, you'll need to:
   - Close the existing position
   - Create a new position with updated price ranges

## Calculating Custom Price Ranges

For custom price range calculations based on our recommendations:

### Formula for Price Range Calculation:

- Lower bound = Current Price × (1 - Range Percentage)
- Upper bound = Current Price × (1 + Range Percentage)

### Example for SOL-BONK with ±6.2% range:

- If current SOL price is $138.20:
  - Lower bound = $138.20 × (1 - 0.062) = $129.63
  - Upper bound = $138.20 × (1 + 0.062) = $146.77

### Asymmetric Range for Token-Stablecoin Pairs:

For pairs like SOL-USDC with uptrend expectation:

- Lower bound = Current Price × (1 - 0.073) = 7.3% below current
- Upper bound = Current Price × (1 + 0.085) = 8.5% above current

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Concentrated Liquidity Laddering

For larger positions, consider splitting into multiple positions with overlapping ranges:

```
Position 1: ±5% from current price (50% of capital)
Position 2: ±10% from current price (30% of capital)
Position 3: ±15% from current price (20% of capital)
```

This "laddering" approach helps balance risk and reward, capturing both high fees from tight ranges and broader market coverage.

### 2. Trend-Based Asymmetric Ranges

For tokens in strong trends:

- **Uptrend Token**: Skew range upward (e.g., -5% to +9%)
- **Downtrend Token**: Skew range downward (e.g., -9% to +5%)
- **Neutral Token**: Use symmetric range (e.g., -7% to +7%)

### 3. Volatility Adaption

For high volatility tokens like MEOW:

1. Check 7-day price volatility range
2. Set price bounds to encompass at least 80% of recent price action
3. Consider wider ranges during market uncertainty

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Price Out of Range

- **Issue**: Token price has moved outside your position range
- **Solution**: Close position and create a new one centered around current price, or wait for price to return to range if trend analysis suggests it will

### Low Fees Despite High APR

- **Issue**: Position showing high APR but earning minimal fees
- **Solution**: Check if price is near the edge of your range; if so, rebalance to center the range around current price

### High Slippage

- **Issue**: High slippage when creating or closing positions
- **Solution**:
  1. Try smaller transaction size
  2. Use limit orders instead of market orders when possible
  3. Execute transactions during periods of lower volatility

### Failed Transactions

- **Issue**: Transactions failing despite having sufficient funds
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure you have enough SOL for gas fees (at least 0.05 SOL)
  2. Check if slippage tolerance is set appropriately
  3. Retry during periods of lower network congestion

## Risk Management Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a smaller allocation to learn how CLMM positions behave
2. **Diversify**: Spread capital across multiple pools with different risk profiles
3. **Set Stop Losses**: Determine exit conditions before entering positions
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Schedule regular checks based on the risk level of your positions
5. **Fee Reinvestment**: Consider compounding earned fees by adding to positions

Remember that concentrated liquidity positions are more active investments than traditional liquidity pools and require closer monitoring for optimal results.
